WHAT IS UNFINISHED AND/OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO EXPAND?

-Would like to add an inventory system.
-More spells/abiltiies for both player and boss
-add ability to save/load progress
-Eventually I would like to take the basic information and structure of the game and add it to an RPG. My current game could be the screen that pops up when you encounter a monster while exploring the world
